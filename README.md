# Programs-for-Practice
- [x] Task #1 - Speed Test
    - You need to write a function that receives an argument. This argument is going to be our speed. If our speed meets a certain condition, it should return a certain string.

    - If our speed is under 10 or equal - return slow
    - If our speed is over 10 and up to 40 - return average
    - If our speed is over 40 and is up to 100 - return fast
    - If our speed is over 100 and up to 180 - return very fast
    - If our speed is over 180 - return extremely fast

- [x] Task #2 - Bonus Score
    - You will be given one number - your score. This score will get some bonus points if some conditions are met. You have to write a function which counts all the bonus points which this score gets and return the new score (your score + bonus points)

    - If the score is under 100 or equal, the bonus points are 10.
    - If the score is over 100, the bonus points are 30% from the score.
    - If the score is over 1000, the bonus points are 20% from the score.
    - The extra bonus points(added after the previous bonus point are already applied):

    - If the score is even, you get +4 bonus points.
    - If the score ends on a 5, you get +5 bonus points.

- [x] Task #3 - Time + 25
    - In this task, you have to write a function, which receives an array as an argument with two string numbers in it. The first number is the hours, and the second is the minutes. Our time will be in the 24-hour time clock. Our function will calculate what the time will be in 25 minutes.

    - You have to make the strings into numbers. Your output for the hours should always be between 0-23 and your minutes should always be between 0-59. Your minutes should always be with two digits. This means that in some cases it should start with a 0.
